# Catalog of U.S. Government Publications Geographic-Based Record Sets

Library Services & Content Management (LSCM) of the U.S. Government Publishing Office created this repository. Metadata and Collection Services (MCS), formerly Library Technical Services (LTS), creates and maintains the collections in the repository.
This repository contains sets of bibliographic records in the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) based on geographic coverage and governmental jurisdictions and reports about the records. The records have been extracted using a list of MARC metadata elements. Our intention is to provide a new product for Federal depository libraries to develop and manage their collections and the GPO records in their catalogs and systems.

We selected a group of MARC fields and subfields to identify records that are related to a particular state or entity. We use the full names, abbreviations, and adjectival forms of the names as the match points. The records have been named and placed in folders corresponding to their [National Collection Service Area (NCSA)](https://www.fdlp.gov/about-the-fdlp/national-collection-service-areas).
