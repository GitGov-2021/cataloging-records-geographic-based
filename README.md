# Catalog of U.S. Government Publications Geographic-Based Record Sets

Library Services & Content Management (LSCM) of the U.S. Government Publishing Office created this repository. Metadata and Collection Services (MCS), formerly Library Technical Services (LTS), creates and maintains the collections in the repository.
This repository contains sets of bibliographic records in the Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) based on geographic coverage and governmental jurisdictions and reports about the records. The records have been extracted using a list of MARC metadata elements. Our intention is to provide a new product for Federal depository libraries to develop and manage their collections and the GPO records in their catalogs and systems.

We selected a group of MARC fields and subfields to identify records that are related to a particular state or entity. We use the full names, abbreviations, and adjectival forms of the names as the match points.

The reports are in the form of tab-separated values spreadsheets. They include several different types of metadata, such as:

- Match points 
  - MARC field names and tags
- Major metadata elements
  - Titles
  - CGP system numbers
  - OCLC numbers
  - Record types
    - Names and MARC codes
  - Record formats
    - Names and MARC codes
  - Agency names
    - Up to three per record
  - SuDoc numbers
    - Up to three per record
  - Item numbers
    - Up to three per record
  - Publication dates
  - PURLs
    - Up to three per record
  - Publications URLs
    - Up to three per record
- Collection development and management elements
  - SuDoc agency classes
    - Up to three per record
  - Shipping list numbers
  - Online equivalent records
    - True or False
  - OCLC numbers of the online equivalent records

We are testing this process with one state in each [National Collection Service Area (NCSA)](https://www.fdlp.gov/about-the-fdlp/national-collection-service-areas):

- Alaska (West)
- Ohio (Midwest)
- Pennsylvania (Northeast)
- Texas (South)

We plan to create record sets for all states and entitites and to combine the files for the states and entities in each NCSA into individual collections.
